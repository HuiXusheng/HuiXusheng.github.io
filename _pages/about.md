# Research Experience

## **Manufacturing technology and application of micro intelligent three-dimensional structure with high precision**

 (**National Major Projects**, 2019-now.)

This project focus on the designing principle, the manufacturing technology on three-dimensional structure with high mechanical properties and response frequency at micron-scale, and its application on micro-actuators and robots. Participated as the core member of the project, proposed the whole design scheme and manufacturing process, built test facilities, and carried out all the experiments.

Micro-actuators illustrated in figures above are composed with shape memory alloy (SMA) and fabricated though Micro-electromechanical Systems (MEMS). These actuators are capable of forming into complex, precise and programmable three-dimensional shapes at micron scale. A voltage lower than 2V is sufficient to activate the actuator and cause it to vibrate at a high response speed up to 100Hz, which is far more superior to most of the present micro-actuators based on SMA. Advantageous performances guarantee the micro-actuators broad application prospects in biomedince, environmental monitoring, industry, and robotics.



## Mechanical embolectomy device for non-invasive medical procedures

(Innovation and entrepreneurship project, 2021-now)

This project aims at developing a set of innovative interventional intelligent mechanical thrombectomy procedures and medical equipment products to face the challenges and needs of interventional neurosurgery for acute stroke.

Benefit from the innovative designing and fabrication method, mechanical embolectomy devices developed in this project can be small enough to be applied in vessels with diameters less than 1mm, where the current products cannot reach.

Another important characteristic of the device is that it can provide high frequency shear force to soften thrombus, which will effectively protect the vessel wall thus, decrease the risk of neurological interventional surgery for acute stroke. Parallel manufacturing of the devices is promised due to its compatibility with semiconductor manufacturing processes, which will greatly reduce the surgery cost and benefit more patients.



## **Electromagnetic power transmission and resonance selectivity for actuation of micro-oscillating-circuit**

This research is to develop a planarized thin-film micro-oscillator-circuit through MEMS technology and verify its selective response ability to magnetic field frequency.

Due to the planar design of the structure, resonance frequency, Q-factor and other parameters of the circuit are fully designable. Compatibility with semiconductor manufacturing processes ensures that it can be easily integrated into other components as a wireless trigger or power harvesting unit. For future research, I am going to combine the wireless power transmission components with micro-actuators I developed, aiming at realizing fully controllable, fast and untethered micro-robots.

## **Laser induced submillimeter robots** 

This research aims at developing untethered micro-robots for drug delivery, cell engineering, and non-invasive medical procedures. Participated as the core member of the project, proposed the original idea, designed the micro-robots,
